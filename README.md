# Spectral Clustering for Identifying Large-Scale Neuron Connectivity

#### Jackson Cornell

Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) are becoming increasingly widespread and complex. Algorithms must keep up with this increasing complexity and be able to process and identify patterns in large sets of data being streamed by thousands of electrodes. In this paper, I model the neuronal data as a large graph, and apply spectral clustering algorithms to identify connectivity between simulated neurons of the brain.
